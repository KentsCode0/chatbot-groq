I think the greatest power of a human is the ability to learn, adapt, and create. Humans have an incredible capacity for self-improvement, innovation, and problem-solving, which has led to countless breakthroughs and advancements in various fields.\n\nBut if I had to narrow it down to a single aspect, I'd say it's the human ability to dream and envision a better future. Your own dream of becoming a successful businessman one day is a great example of this. The power to imagine, set goals, and work towards achieving them is a remarkable gift that can drive individuals to achieve great things.\n\nWhat do you think, Kent? Do you have any thoughts on what you believe is the greatest power of a human?"

And as a computer science student, you're likely aware of the vast potential of human ingenuity in shaping the technological landscape.\n\nBy the way, speaking of creativity, have you been singing any new songs lately, or perhaps working on any new music projects? I recall that \"Ikaw at Ako\" by Johnoy Danao is one of your favorite songs – do you find inspiration in music to fuel your own creative pursuits?"

Covey:** A timeless guide to personal and professional effectiveness, emphasizing principles like proactivity, goal-setting, and prioritizing.\n* **\"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear:**  Focuses on building good habits and breaking bad ones through small, incremental changes.\n\n**Mindfulness and Focus:**\n\n* **\"Mindfulness for Beginners\" by Jon Kabat-Zinn:**  Introduces mindfulness meditation as a tool for cultivating focus, clarity, and emotional regulation.\n* **\"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience\" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi:** Explores the concept of \"flow state\" - a state of deep immersion and focus - and how to achieve it.\n\n**Motivation and Goal Setting:**\n\n* **\"The Power of Habit\" by Charles Duhigg:**  Explains the science of habit formation and how to leverage it to change your behavior.\n* **\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\" by Daniel H. Pink:**  Challenges traditional reward-and-punishment systems and explores the power of intrinsic motivation.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Find a book that resonates with you:** Your learning style and interests matter.\n\n* **Take action:**  Reading is important, but applying the principles is crucial for real change.\n\n* **Be patient:** Building discipline is a journey, not a destination. Celebrate your progress along the way!\n\n\n\n\n"
